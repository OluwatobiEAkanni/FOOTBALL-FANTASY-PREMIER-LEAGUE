What You Did in the Write-Up
Abstract:

You summarized the report's purpose, which was to analyze Fantasy Premier League data to determine if there were significant differences in total points scored across different seasons.
Introduction:

You provided background information on the Fantasy Premier League, explained its significance, and described the focus of the study.
Research Question:

You clearly stated the research question: whether there is a difference in the means of total points scored across seasons from 2016 to 2021.
Variables:

You identified the independent variable (season) and the dependent variable (total points scored).
Hypotheses:

You formulated null and alternative hypotheses to test the significance of the differences in mean total points across seasons.
Dataset Details:

You described the dataset used, including its source (Kaggle) and details about the dataset file.
Methodology:

You outlined the methods used for data analysis, including how you utilized R to generate visualizations (boxplots, histograms) and conducted statistical tests (pairwise t-test with Bonferroni correction).
Visualization:

You included and explained visualizations such as boxplots and histograms to illustrate the distribution of total points scored across seasons.
Analysis:

You presented the results of your statistical tests, including p-values from the pairwise t-test, to determine the significance of differences between seasons.
Conclusion:

You summarized the findings, confirming that there were significant differences in total points scored across different seasons, supporting the alternative hypothesis.
References:

You provided references to sources and datasets used in the report, demonstrating the research foundation for your analysis.
Appendix:

You included additional figures and details related to the dataset, research question, visualizations, and analysis for comprehensive documentation.
Overall, the write-up showcases a robust application of statistical methods, data visualization, and reporting techniques to analyze Fantasy Premier League data.
