<h1>Skills Demonstrated</h1>

<h2>Statistical Analysis: </h2> see <a href="https://github.com/OluwatobiEAkanni/FOOTBALL-FANTASY-PREMIER-LEAGUE/blob/main/analysis.R"> <b>analysis.R</b></a>

<h3>Understanding and Applying Hypotheses:</h3> I formulated and tested hypotheses about the differences in total points scored across different seasons.
<h3>Performing Statistical Tests:</h3> I conducted a pairwise t-test with a Bonferroni correction to compare means between seasons.

<h2>Data Management:</h2> see <a href="https://github.com/OluwatobiEAkanni/FOOTBALL-FANTASY-PREMIER-LEAGUE/blob/main/cleaned_merged_seasons.csv"> <b>cleaned_merged_seasons.csv</b></a>

<h3>Dataset Handling:</h3> I sourced and utilized a dataset from Kaggle, managing and preparing it for analysis in R.
<h3>Data Cleaning:</h3> I referenced using a cleaned dataset, indicating experience with data preprocessing.

  <h2>Data Visualization:</h2> see <a href="https://github.com/OluwatobiEAkanni/FOOTBALL-FANTASY-PREMIER-LEAGUE/blob/main/visualization.R"> <b>visualization.R</b></a> and   <a href="https://github.com/OluwatobiEAkanni/FOOTBALL-FANTASY-PREMIER-LEAGUE/blob/main/visualization.pdf"> <b>visualization.pdf</b></a>

<h3>Creating Boxplots and Histograms:</h3> I created visual representations of data, including boxplots and histograms, to illustrate the distribution and spread of total points across seasons.
<h3>Interpreting Visual Data:</h3> I demonstrated the ability to interpret visual data representations to understand trends and distributions.

  <h2>Programming and Software Proficiency:</h2>
 
<h3>Using R for Statistical Analysis:</h3> I employed the R programming language to perform statistical analyses and visualize data.
<h3>Code Execution and Interpretation:</h3> I included code outputs in my report, showing familiarity with coding practices in R.

  <h2>Research and Documentation:</h2>
 
<h3>Formulating Research Questions:</h3> I identified and articulated a clear research question to guide my analysis.
<h3>Writing and Structuring Reports:</h3> I organized and presented findings in a structured format, including an abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion.

  <h2>Critical Thinking:</h2>

<h3>Analyzing Results:</h3> I critically analyzed the results of statistical tests to draw conclusions about the differences in total points scored across seasons.
<h3>Hypothesis Testing:</h3> I applied statistical methods to test hypotheses about the differences in mean scores.
